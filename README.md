# Cache-Simulator
Disgned and implemented a cache simulator used to study and compare the effectiveness of various cache configurations. Simulator reads memory access trace from standard input, simulates what a cache based on certain parameters would do in response to these memory access patterns, and finally produces some summary statistics.
